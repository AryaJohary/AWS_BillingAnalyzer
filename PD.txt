Connect with AWS Billing API and get all the Invoices for the last 12 months.
Problem Statement: 
To simplify our AWS cost management, we'll automate the process of fetching and analyzing detailed billing information for the past year. This will help us identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize our cloud resources.

Features:
Technical Aspect:

Data Storage:
Store the retrieved data in a suitable format (database) for further analysis.

Report Generation:
Generate comprehensive reports in PDF format.



User Interface

User Interface:
Dashboard: Display key metrics like total monthly cost, cost breakdown by service, and cost trends over time.

Detailed Reports: Provide detailed reports in PDF format, including line item breakdowns, cost comparisons, and recommendations.

Data Visualization:
Time-Series Charts:

Monthly Cost Trend: Plot the total monthly cost over time to identify seasonal variations and cost spikes.

Bar Charts:

Cost Breakdown by Service: Visualize the distribution of costs across different services.

Cost Comparison: Compare costs across different periods.

Pie Charts:

Cost Distribution by Service: Show the percentage of total cost attributed to each service.

User Interaction:
Allow users to: 

Allow users to filter and sort data 

Time-Based Filtering:

Allow users to filter data by specific date ranges (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

Enable filtering data by specific periods (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, last year).

Cost-Based Filtering:

Allow users to filter data by cost thresholds (e.g., costs above a certain amount).

Zoom in on specific periods

Date Range Picker

Enable users to export/import reports in PDF format

Export Reports: Generate PDF files containing report data.

Import Reports: Load PDF files into the system for further analysis or storage.

Common Considerations:
Data Privacy: Handle sensitive billing information securely and comply with relevant data privacy regulations.

Error Handling: Implement robust mechanisms to handle potential API errors and exceptions.

Retry Mechanism: Maximum Retries

Rate Limiting and Throttling: Respect API Rate Limits

Error Logging and Monitoring: Log Error Details & Alerting

Circuit Breaker Pattern: Timeout Mechanism.

Security: Store API tokens securely and avoid hardcoding them in scripts.
